    <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Eclipse plugin provides awesome way to navigate your source code.
      </p>
      <p>
		The <strong>Eclipse Minimap</strong> plugin adds a compact overview of your code (a "Minimap")
		on the right side of the editor window, similar to the minimap feature found in popular editors
		like Visual Studio Code.
      </p>
      <p>
		This allows users to quickly scroll through and understand the structure of long source files
		without losing context. It improves code navigation and boosts productivity, especially in large files.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Usage</h2>
	  <p>
	    The minimap is automatically enabled for supported editors when the plugin is installed. To see the minimap:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Open any supported file (e.g., Java, XML, C/C++, or text files)</li>>
		<li>Open Window - Show View - Other... - Plug-in Development - Minimap</li>
	    <li>The minimap view will be appear and then placed to the right side of the editor</li>
	    <li>Click or scroll within the minimap to quickly navigate to specific sections of the file</li>
	  </ul>
